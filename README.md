# react-native-sort-and-swipe-list
Renders a Sortable and Swipeable List in React Native
Hopefully will update this readme soon.

npm install --save @justinrohweller/react-native-sort-and-swipe-list

import CustomSortAndSwipeList from '@justinrohweller/react-native-sort-and-swipe-list';

<CustomSortAndSwipeList
see example.js for props.
And see two packages documentation for other props.
/>

If you have a warning that says no duplicate props, you tried to use a prop that is already used by this package.

Combines two packages:
react-native-sortable-list: https://github.com/gitim/react-native-sortable-list
react-native-swipe-list-view: https://github.com/jemise111/react-native-swipe-list-view/blob/master/docs/SwipeRow.md

See example.js to see common usage (plus example add/remove rows)
